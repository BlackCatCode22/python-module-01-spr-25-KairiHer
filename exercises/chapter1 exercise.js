### **Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?**

**Answer:**
- **Compiler:** Translates the entire source code of a program into machine code all at once, producing an executable file. The program can then be run without needing the source code or compiler again.
- **Interpreter:** Translates the source code into machine code line by line as the program runs, without producing an intermediate file.

### **Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:**

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The human equivalent would be the brain. It processes information and makes decisions based on the instructions it receives, similar to how the CPU executes commands in a computer.
   
2. **Main Memory (RAM)**: This would be like a person’s short-term memory. It holds information temporarily while you're actively using it (e.g., remembering a phone number for a few minutes).
   
3. **Secondary Memory**: This is akin to long-term memory in humans. It stores information for a long period, even when you're not actively using it, like remembering your home address or phone number.
   
4. **Input Device**: This is similar to the human senses, like the eyes or ears. For example, when you read a question aloud, your eyes take in the information (input).
   
5. **Output Device**: This is like the human ability to speak or write. When you answer a question, you are providing output through speech or writing.
